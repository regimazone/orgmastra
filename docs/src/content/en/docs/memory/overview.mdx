# Memory overview

Memory in Mastra helps agents manage context across conversations by condensing relevant information into the language model’s context window.

Mastra supports three complementary memory systems: [working memory](./working-memory.mdx), [conversation history](#conversation-history), and [semantic recall](./semantic-recall.mdx). Together, they allow agents to track preferences, maintain conversational flow, and retrieve relevant historical messages.

To persist and recall information between conversations, memory requires a storage adapter.

Supported options include:

- [Memory with LibSQL](/examples/memory/memory-with-libsql)
- [Memory with Postgres](/examples/memory/memory-with-pg)
- [Memory with Upstash](/examples/memory/memory-with-upstash)

## Types of memory

All memory types are [thread-scoped](./working-memory.mdx#thread-scoped-memory-default) by default, meaning they apply only to a single conversation. [Resource-scoped](./working-memory.mdx#resource-scoped-memory) configuration allows working memory and semantic recall to persist across all threads that use the same user or entity.


### Working memory

Stores persistent user-specific details such as names, preferences, goals, and other structured data. Uses [Markdown templates](./working-memory-template.mdx) or [Zod schemas](./working-memory-schema.mdx) to define structure.

### Conversation history

Captures recent messages from the current conversation, providing short-term continuity and maintaining dialogue flow.

### Semantic recall

Retrieves older messages from past conversations based on semantic relevance. Matches are retrieved using vector search and can include surrounding context for better comprehension.

## How memory works together

Mastra combines all memory types into a single context window. If the total exceeds the model’s token limit, use [memory processors](./memory-processors.mdx) to trim or filter messages before sending them to the model.

## Getting started

To use memory, install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/core @mastra/memory @mastra/libsql
```

### Shared storage

To share memory across agents, add a storage adapter to the main Mastra instance. Any agent with memory enabled will use this shared storage to store and recall interactions.

```typescript {6-8} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: ":memory:"
  })
});
```

### Adding working memory to agents

Enable working memory by passing a `Memory` instance to the agent's `memory` parameter and setting `workingMemory.enabled` to `true`:

```typescript {1,6-12} filename="src/mastra/agents/test-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const testAgent = new Agent({
  // ..
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      workingMemory: {
        enabled: true
      }
    }
  })
})
```

## Dedicated storage

Agents can be configured with their own dedicated storage, keeping tasks, conversations, and recalled information separate across agents.

### Adding storage to agents

To assign dedicated storage to an agent, install and import the required dependency and pass a `storage` instance to the `Memory` constructor:

```typescript {3, 9-11} filename="src/mastra/agents/test-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

export const testAgent = new Agent({
  // ...
  memory: new Memory({
    // ...
    storage: new LibSQLStore({
      url: "file:agent-memory.db"
    })
  // ...
  })
});
```

## Memory threads

Mastra organizes memory into threads, which are records that group related interactions, using two identifiers:

1. **`thread`**: A globally unique ID representing the conversation (e.g., `support_123`). Must be unique across all resources.
2. **`resource`**: The user or entity that owns the thread (e.g., `user_123`, `org_456`).

The `resource` is especially important for [resource-scoped memory](./working-memory.mdx#resource-scoped-memory), which allows memory to persist across all threads associated with the same user or entity.

```typescript {4} showLineNumbers
const stream = await agent.stream("message for agent", {
  memory: {
    thread: "user-123",
    resource: "test-123"
  }
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
Even with memory configured, agents won’t store or recall information unless both `thread` and `resource` are provided.
</Callout>

> Mastra Playground sets `thread` and `resource` IDs automatically. In your own application, you must provide them manually as part of each `.generate()` or `.stream()` call.

### Thread title generation

Mastra can automatically generate descriptive thread titles based on the user's first message. Enable this by setting `generateTitle` to `true`. This improves organization and makes it easier to display conversations in your UI.

```typescript {3-7} showLineNumbers
export const testAgent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      threads: {
        generateTitle: true,
      }
    },
  })
});
```

> Title generation runs asynchronously after the agent responds and does not affect response time. See the [full configuration reference](../../reference/memory/Memory.mdx#thread-title-generation) for details and examples.

#### Optimizing title generation

Titles are generated using your agent's model by default. To optimize cost or behavior, provide a smaller `model` and custom `instructions`. This keeps title generation separate from main conversation logic.

```typescript {5-9} showLineNumbers
export const testAgent = new Agent({
  // ...
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      threads: {
        generateTitle: {
          model: openai("gpt-4.1-nano"),
          instructions: "Generate a concise title based on the user's first message",
        },
      },
    }
  })
});
```

#### Dynamic model selection and instructions

You can configure thread title generation dynamically by passing functions to `model` and `instructions`. These functions receive the `runtimeContext` object, allowing you to adapt title generation based on user-specific values.

```typescript {7-16} showLineNumbers
export const testAgent = new Agent({
  // ...
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      threads: {
        generateTitle: {
          model: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
            const userTier = runtimeContext.get("userTier");
            return userTier === "premium" ? openai("gpt-4.1") : openai("gpt-4.1-nano");
          },
          instructions: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
            const language = runtimeContext.get("userLanguage") || "English";
            return `Generate a concise, engaging title in ${language} based on the user's first message.`;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
});
```

## Increasing conversation history

By default, each request includes the last 10 messages from the current memory thread, giving the agent short-term conversational context. This limit can be increased using the `lastMessages` parameter.

```typescript {3-7} showLineNumbers
export const testAgent = new Agent({
  // ...
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      lastMessages: 100
    },
  })
});
```

## Viewing retrieved messages

If tracing is enabled in your Mastra deployment and memory is configured either with `lastMessages` and/or `semanticRecall`, the agent’s trace output will show all messages retrieved for context—including both recent conversation history and messages recalled via semantic recall.

This is helpful for debugging, understanding agent decisions, and verifying that the agent is retrieving the right information for each request.

For more details on enabling and configuring tracing, see [Tracing](../observability/tracing).

## Local development with LibSQL

For local development with `LibSQLStore`, you can inspect stored memory using the [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer) extension in VS Code.
