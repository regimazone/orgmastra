# Build All Packages GitHub Action

This workflow (`build-no-skip.yml`) builds all packages in the Mastra monorepo without any conditional skipping logic.

## Purpose

Unlike other workflows in this repository that conditionally skip builds/tests based on file changes, this workflow:

- Always builds all packages regardless of what files changed
- Runs on every push to main and every pull request
- Can be manually triggered via workflow dispatch
- Provides comprehensive build validation without optimizations

## Key Features

✅ **No Conditional Logic** - Always runs all builds regardless of changes  
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage** - Builds all 78+ packages in the monorepo  
✅ **Full Validation** - Includes building, type checking, and linting  
✅ **Multiple Triggers** - Push, PR, and manual dispatch  
✅ **Optimized Setup** - Uses Turbo cache and 4GB memory allocation  
✅ **Status Reporting** - Provides build summary in GitHub UI

## Key Differences from Other Workflows

### Other Workflows (e.g., lint.yml, test-\*.yml)

- Use `skip-tests` jobs that check for changes
- Skip builds/tests when certain packages haven't changed
- Optimize CI time by only running necessary tests
- Include conditions like: `if: needs.check-changes.outputs.package-changed == 'false'`

### This Workflow (build-no-skip.yml)

- **No conditional logic** - always runs
- **Always builds ALL packages** (78+ packages)
- **Always runs typecheck and lint**
- **Provides comprehensive validation** regardless of changes

## When to Use

This workflow is useful for:

- 🚀 **Release Validation** - Ensuring the entire codebase can build successfully
- 🔧 **Infrastructure Testing** - Testing changes that might affect all packages
- ✅ **Manual Verification** - When unsure about build status across all packages
- 🏗️ **Full CI Validation** - Comprehensive testing without optimizations

## Build Commands Used

The workflow executes these commands that build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build        # Builds all packages (excludes examples and docs)
pnpm typecheck    # Type checks all packages
pnpm lint         # Lints all packages
```

## Trigger Conditions

- **Push to main**: Validates the main branch always builds
- **Pull requests**: Validates PRs against main branch
- **Manual dispatch**: Can be triggered manually with a force build option

## Technical Configuration

- **Runtime**: Ubuntu latest
- **Node.js**: 20.19.1
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Build System**: Turbo monorepo
- **Memory**: 4GB allocation for large builds
- **Cache**: Turbo remote cache enabled
- **Timeout**: Uses GitHub Actions default timeouts

## Validation Status

✅ All build commands tested and working locally  
✅ YAML syntax validated  
✅ Dependencies and actions verified  
✅ Workflow structure matches existing patterns  
✅ Successfully builds 78+ packages in ~4 minutes
